 Use INSERT INTO for adding rows

insert into e_commerce.students values(1, 'Vandana', 6,'A','Srinivasarao',9493078611)
insert into e_commerce.students values(2, 'Naresh', 10,'B','Ramesh',8245698197)
insert into e_commerce.students values(3, 'Ajay',10,'A','Srinivasarao',9493078611)
insert into e_commerce.students values(4, 'Vijay', 9,'A','Ramesh', 8245681927)

   Handle missing values using NULL or default

insert into e_commerce.students values(5,'Lakshmi',8,'B','Null',9866478592)
insert into e_commerce.students (roll.no,student_name, class,father_name,parent_no) values (6,'Veda',6,'Srinivas',8885260064)


Use UPDATE and DELETE with WHERE conditions

update e_commerce.students set father_name = 'Veeranna' where roll_no = 5

delete from e_commerce.students where roll_no = 6


Difference between NULL and 0 :- NULL signifies "unknown" or "missing," while 0 signifies "nothing" or "zero quantity."

a default constraint :- The DEFAULT constraint is used to set a default value for a column. The default value will be added to all new records, if no other value is specified

How does IS NULL work :- IS NULL is a specific operator in SQL designed to identify NULL values. A NULL value signifies missing, unknown, or absent data in a field. 
                          When you use WHERE column_name IS NULL, the database returns only those rows where column_name contains a NULL value

 update multiple rows :- When rows need to be updated with different values, a CASE statement can be used within the UPDATE statement. 
                          Example:To update the section for different roll_no values: 
                          Code  UPDATE e_commerce.students
                               SET section = CASE
                               WHEN roll_no = 1 THEN 'C'
                               WHEN roll_no  = 2 THEN 'A'
                               WHEN roll_no  = 3 THEN 'B'
                               END
                              WHERE roll_no  IN (1, 2, 3);

Can we insert partial values :- Yes, it is possible to insert partial values into a table in SQL. This is commonly referred to as inserting a "partial row" or a "partial-width insertion."
                                 When performing a partial insert, you specify only the columns for which you are providing values, and the database handles the remaining columns according to their definitions


What happens if a NOT NULL field is left empty :- If a NOT NULL field is left truly empty (meaning, an attempt is made to insert or update a record with a NULL value in that column), a database error will occur. 
                                                  The specific error message will vary depending on the database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle), 
                                                  but the general outcome is that the operation (insert or update) will fail.

How do you rollback a deletion :- To rollback a deletion, use the ROLLBACK command in a database transaction or the platform's built-in recovery tools to restore deleted data.
